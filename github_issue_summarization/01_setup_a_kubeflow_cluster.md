# Setup Kubeflow

In this section, you will setup Kubeflow on an existing Kubernetes cluster.

## Requirements

* brew update && brew install azure-cli
* brew install source-to-image
* brew install ksonnet/tap/ks
* brew install kubernetes-cli
* pip3 install https://storage.googleapis.com/ml-pipeline/release/0.1.12/kfp.tar.gz --upgrade

Then log in to Azure:

```
az login
```

Deploy the Azure cluster:

```
make azure/setup
```

Once the cluster is running:

```
make kubeflow/setup
```

After completing that, you should have the following ready:

* A ksonnet app in a directory named `kf/ks_app`
* An output similar to this for `kubectl -n kubeflow get pods` command

```bash

## Port Forwarding

Run:

```
make forward/dashboard
```

And then access http://localhost:8080 in a web browser.

Confirm you can see a dashboard.

## Launch a Jupyter Notebook;

* Click on Notebooks.
* Change the namespace to "kubeflow"
* Click the +
* Name the notebook something like `user1`
* Choose the `tensorflow-1.12.0-notebook-gpu:v0.5.0` image.
* Change CPU to 1
* Change Memory to 2.0Gi
* Set Extra Resources to `{"nvidia.com/gpu":"1"}`
* Click Spawn

Back in your terminal, wait until the notebook has launched:

```
make k8s/pods
```

You will initially see:

```
user1-0                                                     0/1     ContainerCreating   0          30s
```

Wait until it's:

```
user1-0                                                     1/1     Running   0          55s
```

Then in the web browser, click the three dots under Actions and choose "Connect"


## Summary

*   We created a ksonnet app for our kubeflow deployment: `ks_app`.
*   We deployed the default Kubeflow components to our Kubernetes cluster.
*   We created a disk for storing our training data.
*   We connected to JupyterHub and spawned a new Jupyter notebook.
*   For additional details and self-paced learning scenarios related to this
    example, see the
    [Resources](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/getting-started/#resources)
    section of the
    [Getting Started Guide](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/getting-started/).
